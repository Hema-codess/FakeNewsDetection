- Model trained using a dataset containing article titles, authors, and labels.
- The app is built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit for web deployment
- Logistic Regression for classification

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app locally using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
